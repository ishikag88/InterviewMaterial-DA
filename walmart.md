 2. Create a query to calculate the total number of transactions per user for each day. This typically involves GROUP BY and COUNT() for aggregation.
 3. Write a query to select projects with the highest budget-per-employee ratio from two related tables (projects and employees). This tests your ability to handle complex joins and aggregations.

Power BI Questions - 

 1. Explain the difference between Import and Direct Query modes. Which would you choose for large datasets? (Direct Query enables real-time data but may be slower, whereas Import is faster but static.)
 2. What are slicers, and how do they differ from visual-level filters? Discuss their impact on data in a Power BI dashboard.
 3. How do you implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI? Explain how you would restrict data access to specific users or groups.
 4. What is a paginated report, and when would you use it? These are ideal for multi-page outputs like invoices or billing statements.

Python Questions -

 1. Write a Python script to identify unique values in a list and count their occurrences. This tests your understanding of sets and dictionaries.
 2. How would you use pandas to merge two datasets and calculate total sales for products with valid promotions? This involves merge(), groupby(), and basic data analysis functions.
 3. Explain the differences between lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python, highlighting their use cases in data manipulation and analysis.
